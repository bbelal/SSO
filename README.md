## Optimizing Neural Networks Using The Social Spider Algorithm

This project consists of two stages. The first stage extracts a vector of features from X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks. In the second stage, we train a neural network using the social spider algorithm proposed by JQ James and VOK Li [1] on the vector of features we extracted in the first stage.
